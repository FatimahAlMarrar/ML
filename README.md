# Lab 1: Git & GitHub for ML

Hi, I am Fatimah Abdullah Al-Marrar
I am a Cybersecurity student. I am interested in Machine Learning because it can be used to improve security systems, detect cyber threats, and analyze large amounts of data to identify attacks and vulnerabilities.
I am looking forward to learning how Machine Learning can be applied in the field of Cybersecurity throughout this course.
